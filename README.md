## Summary

This is a simple front-end app that utilizes react in order to render different components on the site without having to reload the window. The purpose of this site is keeping track of tasks by saving them to a list and adding or removing tasks through a form. There is also the ability to set the tasks as reminders by having a colored border on any specific task.

## Usage

In order to add a task simply click the add button and the add task form appears at the bottom of the tasks list. Once you submit the task it will appear at the bottom of the stack of tasks. If you would like to set a task as a reminder simply double click the task and the green border will appear on that individual task. If you would like to remove a task, click the red 'x' beside the task title text.

## Challenges

The main challenge with this project was figuring out how each component would interact with each other and which props were necessary to pass in to each individual component. The next issue following closely behind was keeping the tasks global in order for each component to be able to make changes to their state.

## Features

The main feature of this site is the ability to have a smooth ui without any page reloads and the ability to add tasks and set them as reminders.

## Future Development

A definite path this project is headed is the ability to save tasks locally so they appear everytime you return to the site as well as intergrating more features in the ui.
